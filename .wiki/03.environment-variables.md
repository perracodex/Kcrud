## Environment Variables Management

The server configurations are managed through environment variables, centralized within a [.env](../.env) file.
This standardizes settings across environments and deployment phases.

* **Configuration Files:** Settings are primarily defined within [HOCON](../kcrud-base/src/main/resources/config) files.
  These configurations use placeholders for variables, filled at runtime from the `.env` file or directly from the environment.

* **Local Development:** Running the server locally automatically incorporates `.env` values.

* **Docker:** In Docker environments, **Docker Compose** uses the `.env` file to set environment variables for containers,
  bypassing the server's direct loading of the `.env` file, and instead injecting the variables directly into the Docker environment.
