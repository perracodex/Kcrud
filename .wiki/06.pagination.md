### Pagination and Sorting

_For more detailed information refer to the [Exposed Pagination Library](https://github.com/perracodex/exposed-pagination)._

Pagination allows optionally to combine multiple sorting fields with corresponding directions.
If a sort field does not have a direction, it will default to `ASC`.

Syntax for sorting: `?sort=field1,direction1&sort=field2,direction2`
Example: `sort=firstName&sort=maritalStatus,desc&sort=email,asc`

To avoid ambiguity when sorting by multiple fields sharing the same name across different tables,
the field name can be prefixed with the table name separated by a dot.
Example: `sort=contact.email,desc`

Some more examples:

* Page 0, 10 elements per page:

`GET` http://localhost:8080/v1/employees?page=0&size=10

* Page 0, 10 elements per page, sorted by first name ascending:

`GET` http://localhost:8080/v1/employees?page=0&size=10&sort=firstName,asc

* Page 0, 10 elements per page, sorted by first name ascending and marital status descending:

`GET` http://localhost:8080/v1/employees?page=0&size=10&sort=firstName,asc&sort=maritalStatus,desc

* No pagination, sorted by first name, default to ascending:

`GET` http://localhost:8080/v1/employees?sort=firstName

### Filtering

When filtering, all fields are optional. The supplied fields will construct an `AND` filter.
For pagination and sorting, the same endpoint syntax as above can be used.

* `POST` http://localhost:8080/v1/employees/filter

```json
{
  "firstName": "AnyName",
  "lastName": "AnySurname",
  "honorific": [
    "MR",
    "MISS"
  ],
  "maritalStatus": [
    "SINGLE",
    "DIVORCED"
  ]
}
```

### Searching

Searching will perform a partial match in a set of predefined fields. The query parameter is case-insensitive.
The server is set to search in first name, last name, work email and contact email.

* `GET` http://localhost:8080/v1/employees/search?query=AnyName
